# Pick your fruit

Geo data of fruit trees based on OpenStreetMap, enriched by data which still needs to be put on the map.

## Scope

The geographic scope is bound to an area near WÃ¼rzburg.
This is the area where I am personally intressted in this data collection,
and I want to generate a relative static dataset and presentation.
The solution can be freely adopted and extended.
